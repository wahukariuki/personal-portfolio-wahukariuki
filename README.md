# Git Essentials Practice Portfolio Template

## Purpose of this Exercise
This template is designed to help you practice core Git essentials and project management skills through building a simple multi-page personal portfolio website. The exercise will guide you in managing a real project with GitHub by simulating a development workflow involving multiple pages, features, and user interactions.

You will gain hands-on experience in:

- Setting up project structure with milestones and issues  
- Managing and labeling GitHub issues representing tasks  
- Creating branches for working on individual issues  
- Making meaningful commits with clear messages  
- Synchronizing your local repository with the remote GitHub repository  
- Using pull requests and understanding branch protection for collaboration

| Understanding Project Structure  | I will explain how projects will link to milestones and be broken down into smaller tasks called issues on GitHub. |
| Issue Management                 | Students will create issues, label them, and assign them to collaborators or themselves when working solo. |
| Project Boards                   | We will discuss the purpose of project boards and guide students on how to create and use them for task tracking and organization. |
| Branch Creation from Issues       | Students will learn how to create branches from issues using the GitHub GUI. |
| GitHub Workflow Basics           | We will cover modifying and creating files, staging changes, making commits with good messages, and pushing to the repository. |
| Local vs Remote Repositories     | I will explain the differences between local and remote repositories and demonstrate commands to synchronize them. |
| Pull Requests and Branch Protection | We will emphasize the importance of pull requests and protecting the main branch to ensure code quality. |

## About This Template
The portfolio website consists of multiple pages:

- **Home:** Overview and welcome section  
- **About Me:** Personal background and skills  
- **Projects:** Showcase of your projects with descriptions  
- **Contact:** Simple contact form (to be integrated with email services like EmailJS or Formspree)  

Each page includes a navigation bar so visitors can easily explore your site. You will edit these pages as you practice Git operations, add new projects, update content, and manage version history.

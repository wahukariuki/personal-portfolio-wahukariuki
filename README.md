# Git Essentials Practice Portfolio Template

## Purpose of this Exercise
This template is designed to help you practice core Git essentials and project management skills through building a simple multi-page personal portfolio website. The exercise will guide you in managing a real project with GitHub by simulating a development workflow involving multiple pages, features, and user interactions.

You will gain hands-on experience in:

- Setting up project structure with milestones and issues  
- Managing and labeling GitHub issues representing tasks  
- Creating branches for working on individual issues  
- Making meaningful commits with clear messages  
- Synchronizing your local repository with the remote GitHub repository  
- Using pull requests and understanding branch protection for collaboration

## What You Will Learn

| Learning Outcome                 | Description (Future Tense) |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Understanding Project Structure  | I will explain how projects will link to milestones and be broken down into smaller tasks called issues on GitHub. |
| Issue Management                 | Students will create issues, label them, and assign them to collaborators or themselves when working solo. |
| Project Boards                   | We will discuss the purpose of project boards and guide students on how to create and use them for task tracking and organization. |
| Branch Creation from Issues       | Students will learn how to create branches from issues using the GitHub GUI. |
| GitHub Workflow Basics           | We will cover modifying and creating files, staging changes, making commits with good messages, and pushing to the repository. |
| Local vs Remote Repositories     | I will explain the differences between local and remote repositories and demonstrate commands to synchronize them. |
| Pull Requests and Branch Protection | We will emphasize the importance of pull requests and protecting the main branch to ensure code quality. |

## About This Template
The portfolio website consists of multiple pages:

- **Home:** Overview and welcome section  
- **About Me:** Personal background and skills  
- **Projects:** Showcase of your projects with descriptions  
- **Contact:** Simple contact form (to be integrated with email services like EmailJS or Formspree)  

Each page includes a navigation bar so visitors can easily explore your site. You will edit these pages as you practice Git operations, add new projects, update content, and manage version history.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Familiarize yourself with the file structure and individual page contents.  
3. Create and manage GitHub issues based on tasks or improvements you want to make.  
4. Use branches linked to your issues for feature development.  
5. Commit changes with meaningful messages reflecting your work.  
6. Push your changes and open pull requests to merge your branches back to main.  
7. Use the GitHub project board and milestone tracking to monitor your progress.
